# How to add to the repository 
Everyone has write access to the repo at the moment. That means that potentially fucks up are behind the corner. 
To avoid such events Follow these steps. 
* Make sure to have the gitHub desktop app ( https://desktop.github.com/ ) 
* Click the tab code on the right and open the repository with github Desktop 
* You can then clone ( download )  the repository onto your machine.
* Once you worked on the files the app will recognize the changes you have made. 
* In the app, in the brach tab, click create new branch. This will be your branch. Name it as the chapter you are working on (Ex: "Gravitation", "1DMotion" ecc... ) 
* After that the app will prompt you to publish the branch on gitHub
* Once you are done with your work you might open a pull request to be reviewed
* IN ANY CASE IF YOU HAVE A DOUBT FEEL FREE TO ASK

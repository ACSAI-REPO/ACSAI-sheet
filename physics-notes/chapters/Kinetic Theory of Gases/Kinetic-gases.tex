%Done by Davide di Trocchio, 1940108, 5/12. 
%This table follows (Halliday: 19.1, 19.2, last part of 19.9) as written on the elearning by the professor. 
%It is based on benjamin's tables, just to have a standard to refer to. 
%Further formulas were not included to reduce confusion. If necessary just say so, i'll add them ASAP
%Also some of the equations do not have units, they need some fact-checking. ty <3
%Note that \end{tabularx} throws an error, idk why but it builds just fine so i didn't bother much.
